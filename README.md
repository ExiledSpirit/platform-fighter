# Objectives

My objective with this project is to create a frame-oriented platform fighter.

The main purpose of this is to understand the industry standards when creating
these kind of games. We have examples like Street Fighter, Guilty Gear Strive
and many others good creations with stable connection and fluid gameplay with
little to almost no critical bugs. If I could, with this project, recreate even
1/10 of such code architecture/ structure I'd be satisfied.
